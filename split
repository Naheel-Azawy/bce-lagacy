     [1mtmux [22m— terminal multiplexer

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
     [1mtmux [22m[[1m-2CluvV[22m] [[1m-c [4m[22mshell-command[24m] [[1m-f [4m[22mfile[24m] [[1m-L [4m[22msocket-name[24m] [[1m-S [4m[22msocket-path[24m] [[4mcommand[24m [[4mflags[24m]]

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     [1mtmux [22mis a terminal multiplexer: it enables a number of terminals to be created, accessed, and controlled from a single screen.  [1mtmux [22mmay be detached
     from a screen and continue running in the background, then later reattached.

     When [1mtmux [22mis started it creates a new [4msession[24m with a single [4mwindow[24m and displays it on screen.  A status line at the bottom of the screen shows infor‐
     mation on the current session and is used to enter interactive commands.

     A session is a single collection of [4mpseudo[24m [4mterminals[24m under the management of [1mtmux[22m.  Each session has one or more windows linked to it.  A window occu‐
     pies the entire screen and may be split into rectangular panes, each of which is a separate pseudo terminal (the pty(4) manual page documents the
     technical details of pseudo terminals).  Any number of [1mtmux [22minstances may connect to the same session, and any number of windows may be present in the
     same session.  Once all sessions are killed, [1mtmux [22mexits.

     Each session is persistent and will survive accidental disconnection (such as ssh(1) connection timeout) or intentional detaching (with the ‘C-b d’
     key strokes).  [1mtmux [22mmay be reattached using:

           $ tmux attach

     In [1mtmux[22m, a session is displayed on screen by a [4mclient[24m and all sessions are managed by a single [4mserver[24m.  The server and each client are separate pro‐
     cesses which communicate through a socket in [4m/tmp[24m.

     The options are as follows:

     [1m-2            [22mForce [1mtmux [22mto assume the terminal supports 256 colours.

     [1m-C            [22mStart in control mode (see the [4mCONTROL[24m [4mMODE[24m section).  Given twice ([1m-CC[22m) disables echo.

     [1m-c [4m[22mshell-command[0m
                   Execute [4mshell-command[24m using the default shell.  If necessary, the [1mtmux [22mserver will be started to retrieve the [1mdefault-shell [22moption.
                   This option is for compatibility with sh(1) when [1mtmux [22mis used as a login shell.

     [1m-f [4m[22mfile[24m       Specify an alternative configuration file.  By default, [1mtmux [22mloads the system configuration file from [4m/etc/tmux.conf[24m, if present, then
                   looks for a user configuration file at [4m~/.tmux.conf[24m.

                   The configuration file is a set of [1mtmux [22mcommands which are executed in sequence when the server is first started.  [1mtmux [22mloads configura‐
                   tion files once when the server process has started.  The [1msource-file [22mcommand may be used to load a file later.

                   [1mtmux [22mshows any error messages from commands in configuration files in the first session created, and continues to process the rest of
                   the configuration file.

     [1m-L [4m[22msocket-name[0m
                   [1mtmux [22mstores the server socket in a directory under TMUX_TMPDIR or [4m/tmp[24m if it is unset.  The default socket is named [4mdefault[24m.  This
                   option allows a different socket name to be specified, allowing several independent [1mtmux [22mservers to be run.  Unlike [1m-S [22ma full path is
                   not necessary: the sockets are all created in the same directory.

                   If the socket is accidentally removed, the SIGUSR1 signal may be sent to the [1mtmux [22mserver process to recreate it (note that this will
                   fail if any parent directories are missing).

     [1m-l            [22mBehave as a login shell.  This flag currently has no effect and is for compatibility with other shells when using tmux as a login shell.

     [1m-S [4m[22msocket-path[0m
                   Specify a full alternative path to the server socket.  If [1m-S [22mis specified, the default socket directory is not used and any [1m-L [22mflag is
                   ignored.

     [1m-u            [22mWhen starting, [1mtmux [22mlooks for the LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE and LANG environment variables: if the first found contains ‘UTF-8’, then the termi‐
                   nal is assumed to support UTF-8.  This is not always correct: the [1m-u [22mflag explicitly informs [1mtmux [22mthat UTF-8 is supported.

                   Note that [1mtmux [22mitself always accepts UTF-8; this controls whether it will send UTF-8 characters to the terminal it is running (if not,
                   they are replaced by ‘_’).

     [1m-v            [22mRequest verbose logging.  Log messages will be saved into [4mtmux-client-PID.log[24m and [4mtmux-server-PID.log[24m files in the current directory,
                   where [4mPID[24m is the PID of the server or client process.  If [1m-v [22mis specified twice, an additional [4mtmux-out-PID.log[24m file is generated with a
                   copy of everything [1mtmux [22mwrites to the terminal.

                   The SIGUSR2 signal may be sent to the [1mtmux [22mserver process to toggle logging between on (as if [1m-v [22mwas given) and off.

     [1m-V            [22mReport the [1mtmux [22mversion.

     [4mcommand[24m [[4mflags[24m]
                   This specifies one of a set of commands used to control [1mtmux[22m, as described in the following sections.  If no commands are specified, the
                   [1mnew-session [22mcommand is assumed.

[1mKEY BINDINGS[0m
     [1mtmux [22mmay be controlled from an attached client by using a key combination of a prefix key, ‘C-b’ (Ctrl-b) by default, followed by a command key.

     The default command key bindings are:

           C-b         Send the prefix key (C-b) through to the application.
           C-o         Rotate the panes in the current window forwards.
           C-z         Suspend the [1mtmux [22mclient.
           !           Break the current pane out of the window.
           "           Split the current pane into two, top and bottom.
           #           List all paste buffers.
           $           Rename the current session.
           %           Split the current pane into two, left and right.
           &           Kill the current window.
           '           Prompt for a window index to select.
           (           Switch the attached client to the previous session.
           )           Switch the attached client to the next session.
           ,           Rename the current window.
           -           Delete the most recently copied buffer of text.
           .           Prompt for an index to move the current window.
           0 to 9      Select windows 0 to 9.
           :           Enter the [1mtmux [22mcommand prompt.
           ;           Move to the previously active pane.
           =           Choose which buffer to paste interactively from a list.
           ?           List all key bindings.
           D           Choose a client to detach.
           L           Switch the attached client back to the last session.
           [           Enter copy mode to copy text or view the history.
           ]           Paste the most recently copied buffer of text.
           c           Create a new window.
           d           Detach the current client.
           f           Prompt to search for text in open windows.
           i           Display some information about the current window.
           l           Move to the previously selected window.
           n           Change to the next window.
           o           Select the next pane in the current window.
           p           Change to the previous window.

           r           Force redraw of the attached client.
           m           Mark the current pane (see [1mselect-pane -m[22m).
           M           Clear the marked pane.
           s           Select a new session for the attached client interactively.
           t           Show the time.
           w           Choose the current window interactively.

     Key bindings may be changed with the [1mbind-key [22mand [1munbind-key [22mcommands.

[1mCOMMANDS[0m
     This section contains a list of the commands supported by [1mtmux[22m.  Most commands accept the optional [1m-t [22m(and sometimes [1m-s[22m) argument with one of
     [4mtarget-client[24m, [4mtarget-session[24m [4mtarget-window[24m, or [4mtarget-pane[24m.  These specify the client, session, window or pane which a command should affect.

     [4mtarget-client[24m should be the name of the client, typically the pty(4) file to which the client is connected, for example either of [4m/dev/ttyp1[24m or [4mttyp1[0m
     for the client attached to [4m/dev/ttyp1[24m.  If no client is specified, [1mtmux [22mattempts to work out the client currently in use; if that fails, an error is
     reported.  Clients may be listed with the [1mlist-clients [22mcommand.

     [4mtarget-session[24m is tried as, in order:

           1.   A session ID prefixed with a $.

           2.   An exact name of a session (as listed by the [1mlist-sessions [22mcommand).

           3.   The start of a session name, for example ‘mysess’ would match a session named ‘mysession’.

           4.   An fnmatch(3) pattern which is matched against the session name.

     If the session name is prefixed with an ‘=’, only an exact match is accepted (so ‘=mysess’ will only match exactly ‘mysess’, not ‘mysession’).

     If a single session is found, it is used as the target session; multiple matches produce an error.  If a session is omitted, the current session is
     used if available; if no current session is available, the most recently used is chosen.

     [4mtarget-window[24m (or [4msrc-window[24m or [4mdst-window[24m) specifies a window in the form [4msession[24m:[4mwindow[24m.  [4msession[24m follows the same rules as for [4mtarget-session[24m, and
     [4mwindow[24m is looked for in order as:

           1.   A special token, listed below.

           2.   A window index, for example ‘mysession:1’ is window 1 in session ‘mysession’.

           3.   A window ID, such as @1.

           4.   An exact window name, such as ‘mysession:mywindow’.

           5.   The start of a window name, such as ‘mysession:mywin’.

           6.   As an fnmatch(3) pattern matched against the window name.

     Like sessions, a ‘=’ prefix will do an exact match only.  An empty window name specifies the next unused index if appropriate (for example the
     [1mnew-window [22mand [1mlink-window [22mcommands) otherwise the current window in [4msession[24m is chosen.

     The following special tokens are available to indicate particular windows.  Each has a single-character alternative form.

     [1mToken              Meaning[0m
     {start}       ^    The lowest-numbered window
     {end}         $    The highest-numbered window
     {last}        !    The last (previously current) window
     {next}        +    The next window by number
     {previous}    -    The previous window by number

     [4mtarget-pane[24m (or [4msrc-pane[24m or [4mdst-pane[24m) may be a pane ID or takes a similar form to [4mtarget-window[24m but with the optional addition of a period followed by
     a pane index or pane ID, for example: ‘mysession:mywindow.1’.  If the pane index is omitted, the currently active pane in the specified window is
     used.  The following special tokens are available for the pane index:

     [1mToken                  Meaning[0m
     {last}            !    The last (previously active) pane
     {next}            +    The next pane by number
     {previous}        -    The previous pane by number
     {top}                  The top pane
     {bottom}               The bottom pane
     {left}                 The leftmost pane
     {right}                The rightmost pane
     {top-left}             The top-left pane
     {top-right}            The top-right pane
     {bottom-left}          The bottom-left pane
     {bottom-right}         The bottom-right pane
     {up-of}                The pane above the active pane
     {down-of}              The pane below the active pane
     {left-of}              The pane to the left of the active pane
     {right-of}             The pane to the right of the active pane

     The tokens ‘+’ and ‘-’ may be followed by an offset, for example:

           select-window -t:+2

     In addition, [4mtarget-session[24m, [4mtarget-window[24m or [4mtarget-pane[24m may consist entirely of the token ‘{mouse}’ (alternative form ‘=’) to specify the most
     recent mouse event (see the [4mMOUSE[24m [4mSUPPORT[24m section) or ‘{marked}’ (alternative form ‘~’) to specify the marked pane (see [1mselect-pane -m[22m).

     Sessions, window and panes are each numbered with a unique ID; session IDs are prefixed with a ‘$’, windows with a ‘@’, and panes with a ‘%’.  These
     are unique and are unchanged for the life of the session, window or pane in the [1mtmux [22mserver.  The pane ID is passed to the child process of the pane
     in the TMUX_PANE environment variable.  IDs may be displayed using the ‘session_id’, ‘window_id’, or ‘pane_id’ formats (see the [4mFORMATS[24m section) and
     the [1mdisplay-message[22m, [1mlist-sessions[22m, [1mlist-windows [22mor [1mlist-panes [22mcommands.

     [4mshell-command[24m arguments are sh(1) commands.  This may be a single argument passed to the shell, for example:

           new-window 'vi /etc/passwd'

     Will run:

           /bin/sh -c 'vi /etc/passwd'

     Additionally, the [1mnew-window[22m, [1mnew-session[22m, [1msplit-window[22m, [1mrespawn-window [22mand [1mrespawn-pane [22mcommands allow [4mshell-command[24m to be given as multiple argu‐
     ments and executed directly (without ‘sh -c’).  This can avoid issues with shell quoting.  For example:

           $ tmux new-window vi /etc/passwd

     Will run vi(1) directly without invoking the shell.

     [4mcommand[24m [[4marguments[24m] refers to a [1mtmux [22mcommand, passed with the command and arguments separately, for example:

           bind-key F1 set-window-option force-width 81

     Or if using sh(1):

           $ tmux bind-key F1 set-window-option force-width 81

     Multiple commands may be specified together as part of a [4mcommand[24m [4msequence[24m.  Each command should be separated by spaces and a semicolon; commands are
     executed sequentially from left to right and lines ending with a backslash continue on to the next line, except when escaped by another backslash.  A
     literal semicolon may be included by escaping it with a backslash (for example, when specifying a command sequence to [1mbind-key[22m).

     Example [1mtmux [22mcommands include:

           refresh-client -t/dev/ttyp2

           rename-session -tfirst newname

           set-window-option -t:0 monitor-activity on

           new-window ; split-window -d

           bind-key R source-file ~/.tmux.conf \; \
                   display-message "source-file done"

     Or from sh(1):

           $ tmux kill-window -t :1

           $ tmux new-window \; split-window -d

           $ tmux new-session -d 'vi /etc/passwd' \; split-window -d \; attach

[1mCLIENTS AND SESSIONS[0m
     The [1mtmux [22mserver manages clients, sessions, windows and panes.  Clients are attached to sessions to interact with them, either when they are created
     with the [1mnew-session [22mcommand, or later with the [1mattach-session [22mcommand.  Each session has one or more windows [4mlinked[24m into it.  Windows may be linked
     to multiple sessions and are made up of one or more panes, each of which contains a pseudo terminal.  Commands for creating, linking and otherwise
     manipulating windows are covered in the [4mWINDOWS[24m [4mAND[24m [4mPANES[24m section.

     The following commands are available to manage clients and sessions:

     [1mattach-session [22m[[1m-dEr[22m] [[1m-c [4m[22mworking-directory[24m] [[1m-t [4m[22mtarget-session[24m]
                   (alias: [1mattach[22m)
             If run from outside [1mtmux[22m, create a new client in the current terminal and attach it to [4mtarget-session[24m.  If used from inside, switch the cur‐

             dent and any session in a group may be killed without affecting the others.  The [4mgroup-name[24m argument may be:

             1.      the name of an existing group, in which case the new session is added to that group;

             2.      the name of an existing session - the new session is added to the same group as that session, creating a new group if necessary;

             3.      the name for a new group containing only the new session.

             Within a configuration file, commands may be made conditional by surrounding them with [4m%if[24m and [4m%endif[24m lines.  Additional [4m%elif[24m and [4m%else[24m lines
             may also be used.  The argument to [4m%if[24m and [4m%elif[24m is expanded as a format and if it evaluates to false (zero or empty), subsequent lines are
             ignored until the next [4m%elif[24m, [4m%else[24m or [4m%endif[24m.  For example:

                   %if #{==:#{host},myhost}
                   set -g status-style bg=red
                   %elif #{==:#{host},myotherhost}

[1mWINDOWS AND PANES[0m
     A [1mtmux [22mwindow may be in one of two modes.  The default permits direct access to the terminal attached to the window.  The other is copy mode, which
     permits a section of a window or its history to be copied to a [4mpaste[24m [4mbuffer[24m for later insertion into another window.  This mode is entered with the
     [1mcopy-mode [22mcommand, bound to ‘[’ by default.  It is also entered when a command that produces output, such as [1mlist-keys[22m, is executed from a key bind‐
     ing.

     Commands are sent to copy mode using the [1m-X [22mflag to the [1msend-keys [22mcommand.  When a key is pressed, copy mode automatically uses one of two key tables,
     depending on the [1mmode-keys [22moption: [1mcopy-mode [22mfor emacs, or [1mcopy-mode-vi [22mfor vi.  Key tables may be viewed with the [1mlist-keys [22mcommand.

     The following commands are supported in copy mode:

     The ‘-and-cancel’ variants of some commands exit copy mode after they have completed (for copy commands) or when the cursor reaches the bottom (for
     scrolling commands).

     The next and previous word keys use space and the ‘-’, ‘_’ and ‘@’ characters as word delimiters by default, but this can be adjusted by setting the
     [4mword-separators[24m session option.  Next word moves to the start of the next word, next word end to the end of the next word and previous word to the
     start of the previous word.  The three next and previous space keys work similarly but use a space alone as the word separator.

     The jump commands enable quick movement within a line.  For instance, typing ‘f’ followed by ‘/’ will move the cursor to the next ‘/’ character on the
     current line.  A ‘;’ will then jump to the next occurrence.

     Commands in copy mode may be prefaced by an optional repeat count.  With vi key bindings, a prefix is entered using the number keys; with emacs, the
     Alt (meta) key and a number begins prefix entry.

     The synopsis for the [1mcopy-mode [22mcommand is:

     [1mcopy-mode [22m[[1m-Meu[22m] [[1m-t [4m[22mtarget-pane[24m]
             Enter copy mode.  The [1m-u [22moption scrolls one page up.  [1m-M [22mbegins a mouse drag (only valid if bound to a mouse key binding, see [4mMOUSE[24m [4mSUPPORT[24m).
             [1m-e [22mspecifies that scrolling to the bottom of the history (to the visible screen) should exit copy mode.  While in copy mode, pressing a key
             other than those used for scrolling will disable this behaviour.  This is intended to allow fast scrolling through a pane's history, for exam‐
             ple with:

                   bind PageUp copy-mode -eu

     Each window displayed by [1mtmux [22mmay be split into one or more [4mpanes[24m; each pane takes up a certain area of the display and is a separate terminal.  A
     window may be split into panes using the [1msplit-window [22mcommand.  Windows may be split horizontally (with the [1m-h [22mflag) or vertically.  Panes may be
     resized with the [1mresize-pane [22mcommand (bound to ‘C-Up’, ‘C-Down’ ‘C-Left’ and ‘C-Right’ by default), the current pane may be changed with the
     [1mselect-pane [22mcommand and the [1mrotate-window [22mand [1mswap-pane [22mcommands may be used to swap panes without changing their position.  Panes are numbered begin‐
     ning from zero in the order they are created.

     A number of preset [4mlayouts[24m are available.  These may be selected with the [1mselect-layout [22mcommand or cycled with [1mnext-layout [22m(bound to ‘Space’ by
     default); once a layout is chosen, panes within it may be moved and resized as normal.

     The following layouts are supported:

     [1meven-horizontal[0m
             Panes are spread out evenly from left to right across the window.

     [1meven-vertical[0m
             Panes are spread evenly from top to bottom.

     [1mmain-horizontal[0m
             A large (main) pane is shown at the top of the window and the remaining panes are spread from left to right in the leftover space at the bot‐
             tom.  Use the [4mmain-pane-height[24m window option to specify the height of the top pane.

     [1mmain-vertical[0m
             Similar to [1mmain-horizontal [22mbut the large pane is placed on the left and the others spread from top to bottom along the right.  See the
             [4mmain-pane-width[24m window option.

     [1mtiled   [22mPanes are spread out as evenly as possible over the window in both rows and columns.

     In addition, [1mselect-layout [22mmay be used to apply a previously used layout - the [1mlist-windows [22mcommand displays the layout of each window in a form suit‐
     able for use with [1mselect-layout[22m.  For example:

           $ tmux list-windows
           0: ksh [159x48]
               layout: bb62,159x48,0,0{79x48,0,0,79x48,80,0}
           $ tmux select-layout bb62,159x48,0,0{79x48,0,0,79x48,80,0}

     [1mtmux [22mautomatically adjusts the size of the layout for the current window size.  Note that a layout cannot be applied to a window with more panes than
     that from which the layout was originally defined.

     Commands related to windows and panes are as follows:

     [1mbreak-pane [22m[[1m-dP[22m] [[1m-F [4m[22mformat[24m] [[1m-n [4m[22mwindow-name[24m] [[1m-s [4m[22msrc-pane[24m] [[1m-t [4m[22mdst-window[24m]

             Break [4msrc-pane[24m off from its containing window to make it the only pane in [4mdst-window[24m.  If [1m-d [22mis given, the new window does not become the cur‐
             rent window.  The [1m-P [22moption prints information about the new window after it has been created.  By default, it uses the format
             ‘#{session_name}:#{window_index}’ but a different format may be specified with [1m-F[22m.

             Capture the contents of a pane.  If [1m-p [22mis given, the output goes to stdout, otherwise to the buffer specified with [1m-b [22mor a new buffer if omit‐
             ted.  If [1m-a [22mis given, the alternate screen is used, and the history is not accessible.  If no alternate screen exists, an error will be
             returned unless [1m-q [22mis given.  If [1m-e [22mis given, the output includes escape sequences for text and background attributes.  [1m-C [22malso escapes non-
             printable characters as octal \xxx.  [1m-J [22mjoins wrapped lines and preserves trailing spaces at each line's end.  [1m-P [22mcaptures only any output
             that the pane has received that is the beginning of an as-yet incomplete escape sequence.

             [1m-S [22mand [1m-E [22mspecify the starting and ending line numbers, zero is the first line of the visible pane and negative numbers are lines in the his‐
             tory.  ‘-’ to [1m-S [22mis the start of the history and to [1m-E [22mthe end of the visible pane.  The default is to capture only the visible contents of
             the pane.

             Put a pane into client mode, allowing a client to be selected interactively from a list.  [1m-Z [22mzooms the pane.  The following keys may be used
             in client mode:

             After a client is chosen, ‘%%’ is replaced by the client name in [4mtemplate[24m and the result executed as a command.  If [4mtemplate[24m is not given,
             "detach-client -t '%%'" is used.

             [1m-O [22mspecifies the initial sort order: one of ‘name’, ‘size’, ‘creation’, or ‘activity’.  [1m-f [22mspecifies an initial filter: the filter is a format
             - if it evaluates to zero, the item in the list is not shown, otherwise it is shown.  If a filter would lead to an empty list, it is ignored.
             [1m-F [22mspecifies the format for each item in the list.  [1m-N [22mstarts without the preview.  This command works only if at least one client is

             After a session, window or pane is chosen, ‘%%’ is replaced by the target in [4mtemplate[24m and the result executed as a command.  If [4mtemplate[24m is
             not given, "switch-client -t '%%'" is used.

             [1m-O [22mspecifies the initial sort order: one of ‘index’, ‘name’, or ‘time’.  [1m-f [22mspecifies an initial filter: the filter is a format - if it evalu‐
             ates to zero, the item in the list is not shown, otherwise it is shown.  If a filter would lead to an empty list, it is ignored.  [1m-F [22mspecifies
             the format for each item in the tree.  [1m-N [22mstarts without the preview.  [1m-G [22mincludes all sessions in any session groups in the tree rather than
             only the first.  This command works only if at least one client is attached.

             Display a visible indicator of each pane shown by [4mtarget-client[24m.  See the [1mdisplay-panes-colour [22mand [1mdisplay-panes-active-colour [22msession
             options.  The indicator is closed when a key is pressed or [4mduration[24m milliseconds have passed.  If [1m-d [22mis not given, [1mdisplay-panes-time [22mis used.
             A duration of zero means the indicator stays until a key is pressed.  While the indicator is on screen, a pane may be chosen with the ‘0’ to
             ‘9’ keys, which will cause [4mtemplate[24m to be executed as a command with ‘%%’ substituted by the pane ID.  The default [4mtemplate[24m is "select-pane -t
             '%%'".

             Search for the fnmatch(3) pattern [4mmatch-string[24m in window names, titles, and visible content (but not history).  The flags control matching
             behavior: [1m-C [22mmatches only visible window contents, [1m-N [22mmatches only the window name and [1m-T [22mmatches only the window title.  The default is [1m-CNT[22m.

             reverse [1mbreak-pane[22m.  The [1m-b [22moption causes [4msrc-pane[24m to be joined to left of or above [4mdst-pane[24m.

             If [1m-s [22mis omitted and a marked pane is present (see [1mselect-pane -m[22m), the marked pane is used rather than the current pane.

             When the shell command completes, the window closes.  See the [1mremain-on-exit [22moption to change this behaviour.

             The TERM environment variable must be set to ‘screen’ or ‘tmux’ for all programs running [4minside[24m [1mtmux[22m.  New windows will automatically have
             ‘TERM=screen’ added to their environment, but care must be taken not to reset this in shell start-up files.

             The [1m-P [22moption prints information about the new window after it has been created.  By default, it uses the format
             ‘#{session_name}:#{window_index}’ but a different format may be specified with [1m-F[22m.

[1mKEY BINDINGS[0m
     [1mtmux [22mallows a command to be bound to most keys, with or without a prefix key.  When specifying keys, most represent themselves (for example ‘A’ to
     ‘Z’).  Ctrl keys may be prefixed with ‘C-’ or ‘^’, and Alt (meta) with ‘M-’.  In addition, the following special key names are accepted: [4mUp[24m, [4mDown[24m,
     [4mLeft[24m, [4mRight[24m, [4mBSpace[24m, [4mBTab[24m, [4mDC[24m (Delete), [4mEnd[24m, [4mEnter[24m, [4mEscape[24m, [4mF1[24m to [4mF12[24m, [4mHome[24m, [4mIC[24m (Insert), [4mNPage/PageDown/PgDn[24m, [4mPPage/PageUp/PgUp[24m, [4mSpace[24m, and [4mTab[24m.
     Note that to bind the ‘"’ or ‘'’ keys, quotation marks are necessary, for example:

           bind-key '"' split-window
           bind-key "'" new-window

     Commands related to key bindings are as follows:

             Bind key [4mkey[24m to [4mcommand[24m.  Keys are bound in a key table.  By default (without -T), the key is bound in the [4mprefix[24m key table.  This table is
             used for keys pressed after the prefix key (for example, by default ‘c’ is bound to [1mnew-window [22min the [4mprefix[24m table, so ‘C-b c’ creates a new
             window).  The [4mroot[24m table is used for keys pressed without the prefix key: binding ‘c’ to [1mnew-window [22min the [4mroot[24m table (not recommended) means
             a plain ‘c’ will create a new window.  [1m-n [22mis an alias for [1m-T [4m[22mroot[24m.  Keys may also be bound in custom key tables and the [1mswitch-client -T [22mcom‐

[1mOPTIONS[0m
     The appearance and behaviour of [1mtmux [22mmay be modified by changing the value of various options.  There are three types of option: [4mserver[24m [4moptions[24m,
     [4msession[24m [4moptions[24m and [4mwindow[24m [4moptions[24m.

     The [1mtmux [22mserver has a set of global options which do not apply to any particular window or session.  These are altered with the [1mset-option -s [22mcommand,
     or displayed with the [1mshow-options -s [22mcommand.

     In addition, each individual session may have a set of session options, and there is a separate set of global session options.  Sessions which do not
     have a particular option configured inherit the value from the global session options.  Session options are set or unset with the [1mset-option [22mcommand
     and may be listed with the [1mshow-options [22mcommand.  The available server and session options are listed under the [1mset-option [22mcommand.

     Similarly, a set of window options is attached to each window, and there is a set of global window options from which any unset options are inherited.
     Window options are altered with the [1mset-window-option [22mcommand and can be listed with the [1mshow-window-options [22mcommand.  All window options are docu‐
     mented with the [1mset-window-option [22mcommand.

     [1mtmux [22malso supports user options which are prefixed with a ‘@’.  User options may have any name, so long as they are prefixed with ‘@’, and be set to
     any string.  For example:

           $ tmux setw -q @foo "abc123"
           $ tmux showw -v @foo
           abc123

     Commands which set options are as follows:

             Set a window option with [1m-w [22m(equivalent to the [1mset-window-option [22mcommand), a server option with [1m-s[22m, otherwise a session option.  If [1m-g [22mis
             given, the global session or window option is set.  [1m-F [22mexpands formats in the option value.  The [1m-u [22mflag unsets an option, so a session inher‐
             its the option from the global options (or with [1m-g[22m, restores a global option to the default).

             The [1m-o [22mflag prevents setting an option that is already set and the [1m-q [22mflag suppresses errors about unknown or ambiguous options.

             With [1m-a[22m, and if the option expects a string or a style, [4mvalue[24m is appended to the existing setting.  For example:

                   set -g status-left "foo"
                   set -ag status-left "bar"

             Will result in ‘foobar’.  And:

                   set -g status-style "bg=red"
                   set -ag status-style "fg=blue"

             Will result in a red background [4mand[24m blue foreground.  Without [1m-a[22m, the result would be the default background and a blue foreground.

             Available window options are listed under [1mset-window-option[22m.

             [4mvalue[24m depends on the option and may be a number, a string, or a flag (on, off, or omitted to toggle).

             Available server options are:

             [1mbuffer-limit [4m[22mnumber[0m
                     Set the number of buffers; as new buffers are added to the top of the stack, old ones are removed from the bottom if necessary to
                     maintain this maximum length.

             [1mcommand-alias[] [4m[22mname=value[0m
                     This is an array of custom aliases for commands.  If an unknown command matches [4mname[24m, it is replaced with [4mvalue[24m.  For example, after:

                           set -s command-alias[100] zoom='resize-pane -Z'

                     Using:

                           zoom -t:.1

                     Is equivalent to:

                           resize-pane -Z -t:.1

                     Note that aliases are expanded when a command is parsed rather than when it is executed, so binding an alias with [1mbind-key [22mwill bind
                     the expanded form.

             [1mdefault-terminal [4m[22mterminal[0m
                     Set the default terminal for new windows created in this session - the default value of the TERM environment variable.  For [1mtmux [22mto

             [1mescape-time [4m[22mtime[0m
                     Set the time in milliseconds for which [1mtmux [22mwaits after an escape is input to determine if it is part of a function or meta key
                     sequences.  The default is 500 milliseconds.

             [1mexit-empty [22m[[1mon [22m| [1moff[22m]
                     If enabled (the default), the server will exit when there are no active sessions.

             [1mexit-unattached [22m[[1mon [22m| [1moff[22m]
                     If enabled, the server will exit when there are no attached clients.

             [1mfocus-events [22m[[1mon [22m| [1moff[22m]
                     When enabled, focus events are requested from the terminal if supported and passed through to applications running in [1mtmux[22m.  Attached
                     clients should be detached and attached again after changing this option.

             [1mhistory-file [4m[22mpath[0m
                     If not empty, a file to which [1mtmux [22mwill write command prompt history on exit and load it from on start.

             [1mmessage-limit [4m[22mnumber[0m
                     Set the number of error or information messages to save in the message log for each client.  The default is 100.

             [1mset-clipboard [22m[[1mon [22m| [1mexternal [22m| [1moff[22m]
                     Attempt to set the terminal clipboard content using the xterm(1) escape sequence, if there is an [4mMs[24m entry in the terminfo(5) descrip‐
                     tion (see the [4mTERMINFO[24m [4mEXTENSIONS[24m section).

                     If set to [1mon[22m, [1mtmux [22mwill both accept the escape sequence to create a buffer and attempt to set the terminal clipboard.  If set to
                     [1mexternal[22m, [1mtmux [22mwill attempt to set the terminal clipboard but ignore attempts by applications to set [1mtmux [22mbuffers.  If [1moff[22m, [1mtmux [22mwill
                     neither accept the clipboard escape sequence nor attempt to set the clipboard.

                     Note that this feature needs to be enabled in xterm(1) by setting the resource:

                           disallowedWindowOps: 20,21,SetXprop

                     Or changing this property from the xterm(1) interactive menu when required.

             [1mterminal-overrides[] [4m[22mstring[0m
                     Allow terminal descriptions read using terminfo(5) to be overridden.  Each entry is a colon-separated string made up of a terminal
                     type pattern (matched using fnmatch(3)) and a set of [4mname=value[24m entries.

                     For example, to set the ‘clear’ terminfo(5) entry to ‘\e[H\e[2J’ for all terminal types matching ‘rxvt*’:

                           rxvt*:clear=\e[H\e[2J

                     The terminal entry value is passed through strunvis(3) before interpretation.

             Available session options are:

                     Set the command used for new windows (if not specified when the window is created) to [4mshell-command[24m, which may be any sh(1) command.
                     The default is an empty string, which instructs [1mtmux [22mto create a login shell using the value of the [1mdefault-shell [22moption.

             [1mdefault-shell [4m[22mpath[0m
                     Specify the default shell.  This is used as the login shell for new windows when the [1mdefault-command [22moption is set to empty, and must

                     below.

                     The colour is one of: [1mblack[22m, [1mred[22m, [1mgreen[22m, [1myellow[22m, [1mblue[22m, [1mmagenta[22m, [1mcyan[22m, [1mwhite[22m, aixterm bright variants (if supported: [1mbrightred[22m,

                     chooses the closest match from the default 256-colour set.

                     The attributes is either [1mnone [22mor a comma-delimited list of one or more of: [1mbright [22m(or [1mbold[22m), [1mdim[22m, [1munderscore[22m, [1mblink[22m, [1mreverse[22m, [1mhidden[22m,
                     [1mitalics[22m, or [1mstrikethrough [22mto turn an attribute on, or an attribute prefixed with ‘no’ to turn one off.

                     Examples are:

                           fg=yellow,bold,underscore,blink
                           bg=black,fg=default,noreverse

                     With the [1m-a [22mflag to the [1mset-option [22mcommand the new style is added otherwise the existing style is replaced.

                     Allow multiple commands to be entered without pressing the prefix-key again in the specified [4mtime[24m milliseconds (the default is 500).
                     Whether a key repeats may be set when it is bound using the [1m-r [22mflag to [1mbind-key[22m.  Repeat is enabled for the default keys bound to the
                     [1mresize-pane [22mcommand.

             [1mstatus-keys [22m[[1mvi [22m| [1memacs[22m]
                     Use vi or emacs-style key bindings in the status line, for example at the command prompt.  The default is emacs, unless the VISUAL or
                     EDITOR environment variables are set and contain the string ‘vi’.

             [1mstatus-left [4m[22mstring[0m
                     Display [4mstring[24m (by default the session name) to the left of the status line.  [4mstring[24m will be passed through strftime(3) and formats
                     (see [4mFORMATS[24m) will be expanded.  It may also contain the special character sequence #[] to change the colour or attributes, for exam‐
                     ple ‘#[fg=red,bright]’ to set a bright red foreground.  See the [1mmessage-command-style [22moption for a description of colours and

                     Aggressively resize the chosen window.  This means that [1mtmux [22mwill resize the window to the size of the smallest session for which it
                     is the current window, rather than the smallest session to which it is attached.  The window may resize when the current window is
                     changed on another sessions; this option is good for full-screen programs which support SIGWINCH and poor for interactive programs
                     such as shells.

                     This option configures whether programs running inside [1mtmux [22mmay use the terminal alternate screen feature, which allows the [4msmcup[24m and
                     [4mrmcup[24m terminfo(5) capabilities.  The alternate screen feature preserves the contents of the window when an interactive application
                     starts and restores it on exit, so that any output visible before the application starts reappears unchanged after it exits.  The
                     default is on.

[1mHOOKS[0m
     [1mtmux [22mallows commands to run on various triggers, called [4mhooks[24m.  Most [1mtmux [22mcommands have an [4mafter[24m hook and there are a number of hooks not associated
     with commands.

     A command's after hook is run after it completes, except when the command is run as part of a hook itself.  They are named with an ‘after-’ prefix.
     For example, the following command adds a hook to select the even-vertical layout after every [1msplit-window[22m:

           set-hook after-split-window "selectl even-vertical"

     All the notifications listed in the [4mCONTROL[24m [4mMODE[24m section are hooks (without any arguments), except [1m%exit[22m.  The following additional hooks are avail‐
     able:

     alert-activity          Run when a window has activity.  See [1mmonitor-activity[22m.

     alert-bell              Run when a window has received a bell.  See [1mmonitor-bell[22m.

     alert-silence           Run when a window has been silent.  See [1mmonitor-silence[22m.

     client-attached         Run when a client is attached.

     client-detached         Run when a client is detached

     client-resized          Run when a client is resized.

     client-session-changed  Run when a client's attached session is changed.

     pane-died               Run when the program running in a pane exits, but [1mremain-on-exit [22mis on so the pane has not closed.

     pane-exited             Run when the program running in a pane exits.

     pane-set-clipboard      Run when the terminal clipboard is set using the xterm(1) escape sequence.

     session-created         Run when a new session created.

     session-closed          Run when a session closed.

     session-renamed         Run when a session is renamed.

     window-linked           Run when a window is linked into a session.

     window-renamed          Run when a window is renamed.

     window-unlinked         Run when a window is unlinked from a session.

     Hooks are managed with these commands:

     [1mset-hook [22m[[1m-gu[22m] [[1m-t [4m[22mtarget-session[24m] [4mhook-name[24m [4mcommand[0m

             the session hooks (for [4mtarget-session[24m with [1m-t[22m).  Like options, session hooks inherit from the global ones.

     [1mshow-hooks [22m[[1m-g[22m] [[1m-t [4m[22mtarget-session[24m]

           MouseDown2    MouseUp2      MouseDrag2   MouseDragEnd2
           MouseDown3    MouseUp3      MouseDrag3   MouseDragEnd3

           TripleClick1  TripleClick2  TripleClick3

     Each should be suffixed with a location, for example ‘MouseDown1Status’.

     The special token ‘{mouse}’ or ‘=’ may be used as [4mtarget-window[24m or [4mtarget-pane[24m in commands bound to mouse key bindings.  It resolves to the window or
     pane over which the mouse event took place (for example, the window in the status line over which button 1 was released for a ‘MouseUp1Status’ bind‐
     ing, or the pane over which the wheel was scrolled for a ‘WheelDownPane’ binding).

     The [1msend-keys -M [22mflag may be used to forward a mouse event to a pane.

     The default key bindings allow the mouse to be used to select and resize panes, to copy text and to change window using the status line.  These take
     effect if the [1mmouse [22moption is turned on.

[1mFORMATS[0m
     Certain commands accept the [1m-F [22mflag with a [4mformat[24m argument.  This is a string which controls the output format of the command.  Replacement variables
     are enclosed in ‘#{’ and ‘}’, for example ‘#{session_name}’.  The possible variables are listed in the table below, or the name of a [1mtmux [22moption may
     be used for an option's value.  Some variables have a shorter alias such as ‘#S’, and ‘##’ is replaced by a single ‘#’.

     Conditionals are available by prefixing with ‘?’ and separating two alternatives with a comma; if the specified variable exists and is not zero, the
     first alternative is chosen, otherwise the second is used.  For example ‘#{?session_attached,attached,not attached}’ will include the string
     ‘attached’ if the session is attached and the string ‘not attached’ if it is unattached, or ‘#{?automatic-rename,yes,no}’ will include ‘yes’ if
     [1mautomatic-rename [22mis enabled, or ‘no’ if not.

     Comparisons may be expressed by prefixing two comma-separated alternatives by ‘==’ or ‘!=’ and a colon.  For example ‘#{==:#{host},myhost}’ will be
     replaced by ‘1’ if running on ‘myhost’, otherwise by ‘0’.  An ‘m’ specifies an fnmatch(3) comparison where the first argument is the pattern and the
     second the string to compare, for example ‘#{m:*foo*,#{host}}’.  ‘||’ and ‘&&’ evaluate to true if either or both of two comma-separated alternatives
     are true, for example ‘#{||,#{pane_in_mode},#{alternate_on}}’.  A ‘C’ performs a search for an fnmatch(3) pattern in the pane content and evaluates to
     zero if not found, or a line number if found.

     A limit may be placed on the length of the resultant string by prefixing it by an ‘=’, a number and a colon.  Positive numbers count from the start of
     the string and negative from the end, so ‘#{=5:pane_title}’ will include at most the first 5 characters of the pane title, or ‘#{=-5:pane_title}’ the
     last 5 characters.  Prefixing a time variable with ‘t:’ will convert it to a string, so if ‘#{window_activity}’ gives ‘1445765102’,
     ‘#{t:window_activity}’ gives ‘Sun Oct 25 09:25:02 2015’.  The ‘b:’ and ‘d:’ prefixes are basename(3) and dirname(3) of the variable respectively.  A
     prefix of the form ‘s/foo/bar/:’ will substitute ‘foo’ with ‘bar’ throughout.

     In addition, the first line of a shell command's output may be inserted using ‘#()’.  For example, ‘#(uptime)’ will insert the system's uptime.  When
     constructing formats, [1mtmux [22mdoes not wait for ‘#()’ commands to finish; instead, the previous result from running the same command is used, or a place‐
     holder if the command has not been run before.  If the command hasn't exited, the most recent line of output will be used, but the status line will
     not be updated more than once a second.  Commands are executed with the [1mtmux [22mglobal environment set (see the [4mENVIRONMENT[24m section).

     The following variables are available, where appropriate:

[1mNAMES AND TITLES[0m
     [1mtmux [22mdistinguishes between names and titles.  Windows and sessions have names, which may be used to specify them in targets and are displayed in the
     status line and various lists: the name is the [1mtmux [22midentifier for a window or session.  Only panes have titles.  A pane's title is typically set by
     the program running inside the pane using an escape sequence (like it would set the xterm(1) window title in X(7)).  Windows themselves do not have
     titles - a window's title is the title of its active pane.  [1mtmux [22mitself may set the title of the terminal in which the client is running, see the
     [1mset-titles [22moption.

     A session's name is set with the [1mnew-session [22mand [1mrename-session [22mcommands.  A window's name is set with one of:

     1.      A command argument (such as [1m-n [22mfor [1mnew-window [22mor [1mnew-session[22m).

     2.      An escape sequence:

                   $ printf '\033kWINDOW_NAME\033\\'

     3.      Automatic renaming, which sets the name to the active command in the window's active pane.  See the [1mautomatic-rename [22moption.

     When a pane is first created, its title is the hostname.  A pane's title can be set via the OSC title setting sequence, for example:

           $ printf '\033]2;My Title\033\\'

     It can also be modified with the [1mselect-pane -T [22mcommand.

[1mENVIRONMENT[0m
     When the server is started, [1mtmux [22mcopies the environment into the [4mglobal[24m [4menvironment[24m; in addition, each session has a [4msession[24m [4menvironment[24m.  When a win‐
     dow is created, the session and global environments are merged.  If a variable exists in both, the value from the session environment is used.  The
     result is the initial environment passed to the new process.

     The [1mupdate-environment [22msession option may be used to update the session environment from the client when a new session is created or an old reat‐
     tached.  [1mtmux [22malso initialises the TMUX variable with some internal information to allow commands to be executed from inside, and the TERM variable
     with the correct terminal setting of ‘screen’.

     Commands to alter and view the environment are:

     [1mset-environment [22m[[1m-gru[22m] [[1m-t [4m[22mtarget-session[24m] [4mname[24m [[4mvalue[24m]
                   (alias: [1msetenv[22m)
             Set or unset an environment variable.  If [1m-g [22mis used, the change is made in the global environment; otherwise, it is applied to the session
             environment for [4mtarget-session[24m.  The [1m-u [22mflag unsets a variable.  [1m-r [22mindicates the variable is to be removed from the environment before start‐
             ing a new process.

     [1mshow-environment [22m[[1m-gs[22m] [[1m-t [4m[22mtarget-session[24m] [[4mvariable[24m]
                   (alias: [1mshowenv[22m)
             Display the environment for [4mtarget-session[24m or the global environment with [1m-g[22m.  If [4mvariable[24m is omitted, all variables are shown.  Variables
             removed from the environment are prefixed with ‘-’.  If [1m-s [22mis used, the output is formatted as a set of Bourne shell commands.

[1mSTATUS LINE[0m
     [1mtmux [22mincludes an optional status line which is displayed in the bottom line of each terminal.  By default, the status line is enabled (it may be dis‐
     abled with the [1mstatus [22msession option) and contains, from left-to-right: the name of the current session in square brackets; the window list; the title
     of the active pane in double quotes; and the time and date.

     The status line is made of three parts: configurable left and right sections (which may contain dynamic content such as the time or output from a
     shell command, see the [1mstatus-left[22m, [1mstatus-left-length[22m, [1mstatus-right[22m, and [1mstatus-right-length [22moptions below), and a central window list.  By default,
     the window list shows the index, name and (if any) flag of the windows present in the current session in ascending numerical order.  It may be cus‐
     tomised with the [4mwindow-status-format[24m and [4mwindow-status-current-format[24m options.  The flag is one of the following symbols appended to the window name:

           [1mSymbol    Meaning[0m
           *         Denotes the current window.
           -         Marks the last window (previously selected).
           #         Window activity is monitored and activity has been detected.
           !         Window bells are monitored and a bell has occurred in the window.
           ~         The window has been silent for the monitor-silence interval.
           M         The window contains the marked pane.
           Z         The window's active pane is zoomed.

     The # symbol relates to the [1mmonitor-activity [22mwindow option.  The window name is printed in inverted colours if an alert (bell, activity or silence) is
     present.

     The colour and attributes of the status line may be configured, the entire status line using the [1mstatus-style [22msession option and individual windows
     using the [1mwindow-status-style [22mwindow option.

     The status line is automatically refreshed at interval if it has changed, the interval may be controlled with the [1mstatus-interval [22msession option.

     Commands related to the status line are as follows:

     [1mcommand-prompt [22m[[1m-1i[22m] [[1m-I [4m[22minputs[24m] [[1m-p [4m[22mprompts[24m] [[1m-t [4m[22mtarget-client[24m] [[4mtemplate[24m]
             Open the command prompt in a client.  This may be used from inside [1mtmux [22mto execute commands interactively.

             If [4mtemplate[24m is specified, it is used as the command.  If present, [1m-I [22mis a comma-separated list of the initial text for each prompt.  If [1m-p [22mis
             given, [4mprompts[24m is a comma-separated list of prompts which are displayed in order; otherwise a single prompt is displayed, constructed from
             [4mtemplate[24m if it is present, or ‘:’ if not.

             Before the command is executed, the first occurrence of the string ‘%%’ and all occurrences of ‘%1’ are replaced by the response to the first
             prompt, all ‘%2’ are replaced with the response to the second prompt, and so on for further prompts.  Up to nine prompt responses may be
             replaced (‘%1’ to ‘%9’).  ‘%%%’ is like ‘%%’ but any quotation marks are escaped.

[1mBUFFERS[0m
     [1mtmux [22mmaintains a set of named [4mpaste[24m [4mbuffers[24m.  Each buffer may be either explicitly or automatically named.  Explicitly named buffers are named when
     created with the [1mset-buffer [22mor [1mload-buffer [22mcommands, or by renaming an automatically named buffer with [1mset-buffer -n[22m.  Automatically named buffers are
     given a name such as ‘buffer0001’, ‘buffer0002’ and so on.  When the [1mbuffer-limit [22moption is reached, the oldest automatically named buffer is deleted.
     Explicitly named buffers are not subject to [1mbuffer-limit [22mand may be deleted with [1mdelete-buffer [22mcommand.

     Buffers may be added using [1mcopy-mode [22mor the [1mset-buffer [22mand [1mload-buffer [22mcommands, and pasted into a window using the [1mpaste-buffer [22mcommand.  If a buffer
     command is used and no buffer is specified, the most recently added automatically named buffer is assumed.

     A configurable history buffer is also maintained for each window.  By default, up to 2000 lines are kept; this can be altered with the [1mhistory-limit[0m
     option (see the [1mset-option [22mcommand above).

     The buffer commands are as follows:

     [1mchoose-buffer [22m[[1m-NZ[22m] [[1m-F [4m[22mformat[24m] [[1m-f [4m[22mfilter[24m] [[1m-O [4m[22msort-order[24m] [[1m-t [4m[22mtarget-pane[24m] [[4mtemplate[24m]
             Put a pane into buffer mode, where a buffer may be chosen interactively from a list.  [1m-Z [22mzooms the pane.  The following keys may be used in
             buffer mode:

                   [1mKey    Function[0m
                   Enter  Paste selected buffer
                   Up     Select previous buffer

                   T      Tag no buffers
                   C-t    Tag all buffers
                   p      Paste selected buffer
                   P      Paste tagged buffers
                   d      Delete selected buffer
                   D      Delete tagged buffers

                   O      Change sort order
                   v      Toggle preview
                   q      Exit mode

             After a buffer is chosen, ‘%%’ is replaced by the buffer name in [4mtemplate[24m and the result executed as a command.  If [4mtemplate[24m is not given,
             "paste-buffer -b '%%'" is used.

             [1m-O [22mspecifies the initial sort order: one of ‘time’, ‘name’ or ‘size’.  [1m-f [22mspecifies an initial filter: the filter is a format - if it evalu‐
             ates to zero, the item in the list is not shown, otherwise it is shown.  If a filter would lead to an empty list, it is ignored.  [1m-F [22mspecifies
             the format for each item in the list.  [1m-N [22mstarts without the preview.  This command works only if at least one client is attached.

             tom separator may be specified using the [1m-s [22mflag.  The [1m-r [22mflag means to do no replacement (equivalent to a separator of LF).  If [1m-p [22mis speci‐
             fied, paste bracket control codes are inserted around the buffer if the application has requested bracketed paste mode.

             Execute the first [4mcommand[24m if [4mshell-command[24m returns success or the second [4mcommand[24m otherwise.  Before being executed, [4mshell-command[24m is expanded
             using the rules specified in the [4mFORMATS[24m section, including those relevant to [4mtarget-pane[24m.  With [1m-b[22m, [4mshell-command[24m is run in the background.

             If [1m-F [22mis given, [4mshell-command[24m is not executed but considered success if neither empty nor zero (after formats are expanded).

             Execute [4mshell-command[24m in the background without creating a window.  Before being executed, shell-command is expanded using the rules specified
             in the [4mFORMATS[24m section.  With [1m-b[22m, the command is run in the background.  After it finishes, any output to stdout is displayed in copy mode (in

             When used without options, prevents the client from exiting until woken using [1mwait-for -S [22mwith the same channel.  When [1m-L [22mis used, the channel
             is locked and any clients that try to lock the same channel are made to wait until the channel is unlocked with [1mwait-for -U[22m.  This command
             only works from outside [1mtmux[22m.

[1mTERMINFO EXTENSIONS[0m
     [1mtmux [22munderstands some unofficial extensions to terminfo(5):

     [4mCs[24m, [4mCr[24m  Set the cursor colour.  The first takes a single string argument and is used to set the colour; the second takes no arguments and restores the
             default cursor colour.  If set, a sequence such as this may be used to change the cursor colour from inside [1mtmux[22m:

                   $ printf '\033]12;red\033\\'

     [4mSs[24m, [4mSe[24m  Set or reset the cursor style.  If set, a sequence such as this may be used to change the cursor to an underline:

                   $ printf '\033[4 q'

             If [4mSe[24m is not set, Ss with argument 0 will be used to reset the cursor style instead.

     [4mTc[24m      Indicate that the terminal supports the ‘direct colour’ RGB escape sequence (for example, \e[38;2;255;255;255m).

             If supported, this is used for the OSC initialize colour escape sequence (which may be enabled by adding the ‘initc’ and ‘ccc’ capabilities to
             the [1mtmux [22mterminfo(5) entry).

     [4mMs[24m      Store the current buffer in the host terminal's selection (clipboard).  See the [4mset-clipboard[24m option above and the xterm(1) man page.

[1mCONTROL MODE[0m
     [1mtmux [22moffers a textual interface called [4mcontrol[24m [4mmode[24m.  This allows applications to communicate with [1mtmux [22musing a simple text-only protocol.

     In control mode, a client sends [1mtmux [22mcommands or command sequences terminated by newlines on standard input.  Each command will produce one block of
     output on standard output.  An output block consists of a [4m%begin[24m line followed by the output (which may be empty).  The output block ends with a [4m%end[0m
     or [4m%error[24m.  [4m%begin[24m and matching [4m%end[24m or [4m%error[24m have two arguments: an integer time (as seconds from epoch) and command number.  For example:

           %begin 1363006971 2
           0: ksh* (1 panes) [80x24] [layout b25f,80x24,0,0,2] @2 (active)
           %end 1363006971 2

     The [1mrefresh-client -C [22mcommand may be used to set the size of a client in control mode.

     In control mode, [1mtmux [22moutputs notifications.  A notification will never occur inside an output block.

     The following notifications are defined:

     [1m%client-session-changed [4m[22mclient[24m [4msession-id[24m [4mname[0m
             The client is now attached to the session with ID [4msession-id[24m, which is named [4mname[24m.

     To create a new [1mtmux [22msession running vi(1):

           $ tmux new-session vi

     Most commands have a shorter form, known as an alias.  For new-session, this is [1mnew[22m:

           $ tmux new vi

     Alternatively, the shortest unambiguous form of a command is accepted.  If there are several options, they are listed:

           $ tmux n
           ambiguous command: n, could be: new-session, new-window, next-window

     Within an active session, a new window may be created by typing ‘C-b c’ (Ctrl followed by the ‘b’ key followed by the ‘c’ key).

     Windows may be navigated with: ‘C-b 0’ (to select window 0), ‘C-b 1’ (to select window 1), and so on; ‘C-b n’ to select the next window; and ‘C-b p’
     to select the previous window.

     A session may be detached using ‘C-b d’ (or by an external event such as ssh(1) disconnection) and reattached with:

           $ tmux attach-session

     Typing ‘C-b ?’ lists the current key bindings in the current window; up and down may be used to navigate the list or ‘q’ to exit from it.

     Commands to be run when the [1mtmux [22mserver is started may be placed in the [4m~/.tmux.conf[24m configuration file.  Common examples include:

     Changing the default prefix key:

           set-option -g prefix C-a
           unbind-key C-b
           bind-key C-a send-prefix

     Turning the status line off, or changing its colour:

           set-option -g status off
           set-option -g status-style bg=blue

     Setting other options, such as the default command, or locking after 30 minutes of inactivity:

           set-option -g default-command "exec /bin/ksh"
           set-option -g lock-after-time 1800

     Creating new key bindings:

           bind-key b set-option status
           bind-key / command-prompt "split-window 'exec man %%'"
           bind-key S command-prompt "new-window -n %1 'ssh %1'"
